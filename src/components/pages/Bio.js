        My name is Mikayla and I am very happy to meet you! I hail from
        Seattle, WA. I know several web languages, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, React. 
        Database languages: MySQL, Sequelize, MongoDB, and graphQL.
        Other specialties: Handlebars, GitHub, Insomnia, and Heroku. 
        I have explored using python and 
        love learning new things and new languages. I am always looking for new coding podcast recommendation. 
        Dream job: working at Twitter to give the people what they want which is an edit button.</p>

        I love animals, reading, going for hikes, playing video
        games and tabletop games. Problem solving is the main reason that I
        sparked an interest in learning how to code. I am an ernest communicator and can work independently or 
        with a group to create a MVP. 
        I am still a licensed veterinary technician and have been for the last 6 years and worked in
        the veterinary field for 11 years. I love learning new things and have
        a passion for technology and learning how things work. Fun fact about
        myself: I ran an MRI on a bear cub and got my shoelaces untied
        by a sea otter.
